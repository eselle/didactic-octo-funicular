This is test for javascript developer, that contains a node api

## Install

Clone this repository, and in the new directory, run:

    npm install
    node server.js

This will run a Node server on `localhost:3000` that you can visit in
your browser.

## Structure

`server.js` in the root directory is the Node server that features
very simple token-based authentication.

## Task

In the folder structure you will find a html app that contains some implementation
for a simple shopping cart.

1. At the moment data is hardcoded inside index.html, so first task would be to take data
from the API and replace the hardcoded bytes and implement some form of authentication
process.

2. Two things in UI are still missing search box on upper box and also add items on the
shopping cart (box on the left side)
